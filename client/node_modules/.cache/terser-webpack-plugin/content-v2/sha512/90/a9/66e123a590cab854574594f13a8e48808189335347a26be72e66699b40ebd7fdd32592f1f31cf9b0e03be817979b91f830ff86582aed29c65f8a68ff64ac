Predominantly consisting of creating, launching and managing websites from the ground up for businesses small to medium in size. I have gained a wealth of experience within this role, especially in both front end and back end development areas. I played an integral part in modernising Exacta Print’s web department/web workflow and managed to reduce outgoings substantially for several web-based services, both b2b and customer facing. I was also given the opportunity to break up the web work with graphic and print design jobs for customers looking for artwork for their print. In addition to the experience gained with commercial and customer facing web services and projects, I now have solid experience working within a fast-paced creative environment, managing unexpected jobs or events and improving workflow and web management processes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Freelance<span className='pipe'>|</span>Graphic Designer<br />Jan '16 - Feb '17</strong><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDesigning solutions for clients while adhering to mutually developed briefs.
