They wanted the design to be clean, simple and subtle, but still be memorable. My design incorporates a strong TT, fused together to represent trust and reliability. The whole logo mark slants forward, to reflect the company\\'s quick and forward thinking process, and the bar the double T sits on creates the silhouette of a rail track. The choice of teal for the bar is a combination of some of the company\\'s transport methods; blue to represent transit across sea, green to represent transit across land.',\n\t images: [\n\t \t'/img/tatana-thumbnail.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-1.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-2.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-3.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-4.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-5.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-6.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/tatana-7.jpg'\n\t ]\n\t},\n\t{ title: 'Summerteeth Recordings',\n\t\t id: '/summerteeth-recordings',\n\t   type: 'Branding',\n\t   copy: 'Summerteeth Records are a small independent recording and sound engineering company that focuses on high quality artists with a strong DIY ethos. The client needed a logo that would work well on all forms of marketing, from digital to print, and would appeal to their target audience—indie music fans. They wanted the final design to be tight, angular and minimal, but still incorporate themes that reflected their punk, DIY roots. With that in mind I created the following logo—based around the hugely iconic and instantly recognisable shape of an LP, I hand drew the type and circle to maintain a DIY feel then scanned and copied the design several times to give it a grainy, noisy quality. I utilised use of space to give a more ambient, spaced out vibe to the logo mark, and the final design incorporates both minimal, memorable design with the DIY aesthetic of the label.',\n\t images: [\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-thumbnail.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-1.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-2.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-3.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-4.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-5.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-6.jpg',\n\t \t'/img/summerteeth-7.jpg'\n\t ]\n\t},\n\t{ title: 'MacRoberts',\n\t\t id: '/macroberts',\n\t   type: 'Graphic',\n\t   copy: 'This collection of marketing and promotional materials was designed for MacRoberts\\' internal marketing team. The pattern was a rebrand of their previous design. I carried over the triangular motif but softened the colour pallete, resized to something more aesthetically pleasing, and worked closely and extensively with the client to ensure all promotional material was coherent and cohesive. A key aspect of the rebrand was scaling and flexibility as the marketing team had to brand many different marketing materials with these designs.
